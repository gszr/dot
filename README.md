# dot

dot files manager.

## Download

Download the latest version with:

```sh
$ curl --remote-name-all --location  $( \
    curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/gszr/dot/releases/latest \
    | grep "browser_download_url.*$(uname -s)-$(uname -m).*" \
    | cut -d : -f 2,3 \
    | tr -d \" )
```

(Binaries were aptly named (check `.goreleaser.yml`) so that 
`uname` could be used directly - no `if`s : )

Linux and MacOS on `x86_64` or `arm64`.

## What

* Map dotfiles living in a directory somehwere -- say, a git repo --  
  to their destination
* Future: fetch additional resources from the web, also mapping them to their 
  destination

## Usage

Let's start with an example:

```yaml
map:
  i3:
  imwheelrc:
  config/alacritty.yml:
  config/redshift.conf:
```

### Behavior

- Top-level `files` map lists files along with mapping attributes
- Each file name maps to a file in the current working directory -- ie,
  `i3` and `imwheelrc` are both files in the CWD where the `dot` CLI was
  executed. Files may list the following optional mapping attributes:
  * `to`: where it ends up
    - If the file starts with a `~`, it is resolved to the current user's home
      dir
    - If omitted, the default is `~/.<file name>`; in the example above,
      `i3` maps to `~/.i3`
  * `as`: how the mapping is performed - can be `symlink` or `copy`, for a symlink and a copy,
    respectively (the default is a symlink)
  * `os`: restricts the OS where the mapping applies; can be `linux`, `macos` or
    `all` - if not specified, `all` is implied
  * `with`: valid only `as: copy` is used; lists variables whose values are replaced
    in the input file's contents using the [Go templating engine](https://pkg.go.dev/text/template).
    Currently, the feature exposes the only `.Os` variable within `with` values.

### Examples

```yaml
map:
  i3:
    os: linux
  xinitrc:
    os: linux
  Xresources:
    os: linux
  imwheelrc:
    os: linux
  config/alacritty.yml:
    os: macos
  docker/config.json:
    as: copy

opt:
  cd: dots/
```

In this example, all files live under a subdirectory `dots/`:
```sh
$ tree .
.
├── dots
│   ├── config
│   │   └── alacritty.yml
│   ├── docker
│   │   └── config.json
│   ├── i3
│   ├── imwheelrc
│   ├── xinitrc
│   └── Xresources
└── dot.yml
```

#### Templating

Some system utilities have built-in support for simple variable substitutions through
environment variables, while others do not. In these cases, one can use `dot`'s templating
feature to allow for customizations.

Let's take the following dots spec as an example:

```yaml
map:
  gnupg/gpg-agent.conf:
    as: copy
    with:
      PinentryPrefix: '{{if eq .Os "darwin"}}/opt/homebrew/bin{{else}}/usr/bin{{end}}'
```

The contents of `gnupg/gpg-agent.conf` look like the following:
```
default-cache-ttl 1800
max-cache-ttl 3600
enable-ssh-support
pinentry-program {{.PinentryPrefix}}/pinentry-tty
```

This will result in the correct path to `pinentry-tty` being set during the dot
file mapping process.

#### Fetching resources

Sometimes, our environment relies not only on our own dotfiles, but also on 
remote resources that need to be downloaded. For example, one may use Vim plugins 
that are hosted in GitHub ([like myself][1]). For these and other similar use
cases, `dot` supports fetching remote resources.

See the following chunk of my own `dot` file:

```yaml
fetch:
- url: https://github.com/gszr/dynamic-colors
  to: ~/.dynamic-colors
  as: git
- url: https://github.com/altercation/vim-colors-solarized
  to: ~/.vim/pack/plugins/start/vim-colors-solarized
  as: git
- url: https://github.com/ruanyl/vim-gh-line
  to: ~/.vim/pack/plugins/start/vim-gh-line
  as: git
- url: https://github.com/mhinz/vim-rfc
  to: ~/.vim/pack/plugins/start/vim-rfc
  as: git
- url: https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki
  to: ~/.vim/pack/plugins/start/vimwiki
  as: git
```

With this, when I run `dot`, all of the Git repositories will be cloned and 
placed in the destination paths indicated in the `to` field.

Additionally to Git repositories, files can also be downloaded with the
`as` field set to `file`.
